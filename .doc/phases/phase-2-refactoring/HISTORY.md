# Phase 2: History

## Session 2025-10-02-001

**Feature:** Phase 2 Planning & Design
**Status:** Complete ✅
**Files Changed:**
- .doc/phases/phase-2-refactoring/README.md (created, 759 lines)
- .doc/phases/phase-2-refactoring/TODO.md (created)
- .doc/phases/phase-2-refactoring/ISSUES_SCAN.md (created, 10 issues identified)
- .doc/phases/phase-2-refactoring/HISTORY.md (created, this file)

**Changes:**
- Created complete design document (README.md)
- Defined all features and commands
- Designed user flow (10 steps)
- Planned module architecture
- Created implementation plan
- Identified 10 potential issues
- Created task breakdown (TODO.md)

**Decisions:**
- Short flags for focus modes (--perf, --read, --best, --design) → Better UX
- Interactive mode selection if no flags → User-friendly
- Always show preview → Safety first
- Always require confirmation → No auto-apply
- Reuse existing components → Faster development
- Start with single-file support → MVP scope
- Add multi-file later → Future enhancement

**Issues Identified:**
1. AI response format inconsistency (HIGH)
2. Code indentation preservation (HIGH)
3. Syntax validation needed (HIGH)
4. Multi-file dependencies (MEDIUM)
5. Large file performance (MEDIUM)
6. Backup failure handling (MEDIUM)
7. Concurrent refactorings conflict (LOW)
8. AI hallucination (MEDIUM)
9. Preview diff clarity (LOW)
10. API rate limits (LOW)

**Solutions Planned:**
- Robust JSON parsing with fallback
- Indentation detection and preservation
- Syntax validation before applying
- Single-file MVP with warnings
- File size limits (5000 lines)
- Fail fast on backup failure
- Conflict detection
- Quality checks on suggestions
- Context in diff display
- Rate limiting if needed

**Tests:** Not yet started

## Session 2025-10-02-002

**Feature:** Design Finalization & Decisions
**Status:** Complete ✅
**Files Changed:**
- .doc/phases/phase-2-refactoring/README.md (modified, updated success criteria)
- .doc/phases/phase-2-refactoring/HISTORY.md (modified, this entry)

**Changes:**
- Finalized design decisions with user
- Updated success criteria with specific limits
- Ready to start implementation

**Decisions Made:**
- Language priority: Python, JS, TS (support others too) → Focus on most used
- File size limit: 1,000 lines or under → Prevent performance issues
- Suggestion count: 3-5 per file → Focused, not overwhelming
- Multi-file support: Phase 3 (later) → Single-file quality first

**Reasoning:**
- 1,000 line limit prevents API timeouts and high costs
- 3-5 suggestions keeps it manageable and focused
- Single-file first allows us to perfect the core feature
- Multi-file is complex (import analysis) - better to do right later

**Tests:** Not yet started

## Session 2025-10-02-003

**Feature:** CodeAnalyzer Module
**Status:** Complete ✅
**Files Changed:**
- src/codeAnalyzer.js (created, 410 lines)
- test-sample.py (created, test file)

**Changes:**
- Implemented complete CodeAnalyzer class
- Added file analysis with metrics
- Added language detection (10+ languages)
- Added file size validation (1,000 line limit)
- Implemented code metrics (lines, functions, complexity)
- Implemented code smell detection (long functions, duplicates, complex conditions, long lines)
- Added context extraction for AI
- Added initial suggestion generation

**Decisions:**
- File size limit: 1,000 lines → Enforced in analyzeFile()
- Complexity calculation: Simplified cyclomatic → Count decision points
- Function detection: Pattern-based → Works for Python, JS, TS
- Duplicate detection: Line-based → Simple but effective

**Issues:**
- None encountered

**Tests:** 
- ✅ Tested with Python sample file
- ✅ Detected 2 functions
- ✅ Detected 1 duplicate
- ✅ Detected 1 complex condition
- ✅ Generated 2 suggestions
- Pending: JavaScript test

## Session 2025-10-02-004

**Feature:** CodeRefactorer Module
**Status:** Complete ✅
**Files Changed:**
- src/codeRefactorer.js (created, 410 lines)

**Changes:**
- Implemented complete CodeRefactorer class
- Created AI prompt builder with focus areas
- Implemented robust JSON parsing (3 fallback methods)
- Added suggestion validation (required fields, types, line numbers)
- Implemented refactoring application logic
- Added indentation preservation
- Added line replacement with sorting
- Created preview generation
- Added basic syntax validation

**Decisions:**
- Robust parsing: Try direct JSON, then markdown, then any JSON → Handle AI variations
- Validate all suggestions: Check required fields → Fail fast on invalid
- Sort bottom-to-top: Apply from end to start → Preserve line numbers
- Preserve indentation: Detect and apply → Python-safe
- Limit 5 suggestions: Slice to max 5 → Keep focused

**Issues:**
- None encountered

**Tests:**
- ✅ Module created successfully
- ✅ All methods implemented
- Pending: Integration test with real AI
