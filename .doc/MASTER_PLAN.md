## 🚀 Getting Started with Current Phase

### Step 1: Create Folder Structure
```bash
mkdir -p .doc/phase-2-refactoring
cd .doc/phase-2-refactoring
```

### Step 2: Move Planning Documents
- Move REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md → phase-2-refactoring/PLAN.md
- Create TODO.md with daily tasks
- Create PROGRESS.md for tracking

### Step 3: Start Implementation
- Begin Day 1: CodeAnalyzer module
- Follow PLAN.md step by step
- Update PROGRESS.md daily

---

## 📝 Notes

- Each phase is independent but builds on previous work
- Phases can be developed in parallel if needed
- Each phase has its own folder with complete documentation
- Progress is tracked separately for each phase
- All phases follow the same clean UI principles established in Phase 1

---
