## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines how we develop features and complete phases in DocAI. It ensures:
- Consistent development process
- High quality implementation
- Clear communication between human and AI

## 📋 Core Principles

### 1. **Design First, Code Second**
- Write detailed design before any code
- Discuss and agree on approach
- Identify issues early
- Clear specification to follow

### 2. **Fail Fast, Fix Right**
- Errors stop execution immediately
- Analyze root cause
- Solve problem properly
- Make implementation secure

### 3. **Document Everything**
- Track all changes
- Record all decisions
- Help future AI understand context
- Maintain clear history

### 4. **Test Thoroughly**
- Test at end of each phase
- Document all test scenarios
- Record failures and solutions
- Ensure quality before moving on

### 5. **Collaborate Continuously**
- Work together as we go
- AI suggests, human decides
- Discuss decisions together
- Catch issues immediately

## 🤝 AI-Human Collaboration

### **AI Role (Assistant):**

- **Review:** Check code quality, suggest improvements
- **Suggest:** Propose solutions and approaches
- **Explain:** Clarify technical concepts
- **Test:** Suggest test scenarios
- **Document:** Help write documentation
- **Catch:** Identify issues early
- **Partner:** Work together continuously

### **Human Role (Decision Maker):**

- **Decide:** Make final decisions
- **Direct:** Guide implementation
- **Approve:** Approve designs and changes
- **Prioritize:** Choose what to build
- **Validate:** Ensure it meets needs

### **Collaboration Flow:**

```
1. Human: "I want feature X"
2. AI: "Here's design approach A, B, C"
3. Human & AI: Discuss options
4. Human: "Let's go with B"
5. AI: "Here's detailed design for B"
6. Human: "Looks good, proceed"
7. AI: Implements piece 1
8. AI: "Piece 1 done, review?"
9. Human: Reviews
10. Human: "Good" or "Change this"
11. Repeat until complete
```

---

## 🎯 Decision Making Process

### **When Decisions Are Needed:**

1. **AI Identifies Decision Point**
   - "We need to choose between A and B"
   - Explains options
   - Shows pros/cons
   - Suggests recommendation

2. **Human and AI Discuss**
   - Ask questions
   - Clarify implications
   - Consider alternatives

3. **Human Decides**
   - Makes final choice
   - Provides reasoning

4. **Document Decision**
   - Record in HISTORY.md
   - Include reasoning
   - Note alternatives considered

---

## 🔄 Rollback Strategy

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

**Primary Method: Git Revert**
```bash
# Undo last commit
git revert HEAD

# Undo specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

**When to Use:**
- Feature has critical bug
- Implementation wrong
- Need to start over

**Process:**
1. Identify problem
2. Discuss with AI
3. Decide to rollback
4. Git revert
5. Document in HISTORY.md
6. Re-implement properly

---

## 🚨 Error Handling Strategy

### **Fail Fast Approach:**

**When Error Occurs:**
1. **Stop Immediately**
   - Don't continue with error
   - Don't try to work around
   - Stop and analyze

2. **Analyze Root Cause**
   - What caused the error?
   - Why did it happen?
   - What's the real problem?

3. **Discuss Solution**
   - Human and AI discuss
   - Identify proper fix
   - Not just workaround

4. **Implement Fix**
   - Fix root cause
   - Not just symptoms
   - Make it secure

5. **Document**
   - Record in HISTORY.md
   - Problem + Solution
   - Prevent future occurrence

6. **Test**
   - Verify fix works
   - Test edge cases
   - Ensure secure

---

## 📊 Performance Guidelines

### **Soft Performance Goals:**

**Not hard requirements, but aim for:**

- **Speed:** Reasonably fast for user
- **Memory:** Don't use excessive RAM
- **Scalability:** Works with large projects
- **Responsiveness:** Shows progress

**Approach:**
- Monitor performance during development
- If slow, discuss optimization
- Don't over-optimize early
- Focus on correctness first

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### **Policy: Document Breaking Changes**

**Approach:**
- Can make breaking changes
- Must document clearly
- Must explain in commit message
- Must note in CHANGELOG

**When Breaking:**
1. Identify breaking change
2. Document in commit:
   ```
   BREAKING CHANGE: Removed --inline flag
   
   The --inline flag is now default behavior.
   Users should remove --inline from their commands.
   ```
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Note in HISTORY.md

**Goal:** Clear communication, not absolute compatibility

---

## 📝 Commit Strategy

### **Micro-Commits Approach:**

**Commit Frequently:**
- After each small piece
- After each function
- After each fix
- After each feature

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type: brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

- Change 1
- Change 2

BREAKING CHANGE: If applicable
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Tests
- `chore:` Maintenance

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add scan command"
git commit -m "fix: Handle missing git repository"
git commit -m "docs: Update README with examples"
```
