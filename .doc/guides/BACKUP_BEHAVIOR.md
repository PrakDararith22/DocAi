# Automatic Backup Behavior

## 🎯 New Backup System

**Backups are now ALWAYS created automatically for safety!**

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **1. Before Modification**
```bash
$ docai generate ./src

💾 Creating safety backups...
✓ Backed up 3 files
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Automatically creates `.bak` files
- ✅ No flag needed
- ✅ Always enabled for safety

---

### **2. On Success**
```bash
📝 Inserting docstrings...
✓ Modified 3 files

🧹 Cleaning up backup files...
✓ Cleaned up 3 backup files

💡 Backups automatically removed (all changes successful)
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ All modifications successful
- ✅ Backups automatically deleted
- ✅ Clean workspace

---

### **3. On Failure**
```bash
📝 Inserting docstrings...
✗ Failed to modify utils.py

⚠️  Some files failed to modify. Restoring from backups...
✓ Restored utils.py

💾 Backup files kept for failed modifications
   You can manually restore from .bak files if needed
```

**What happens:**
- ❌ Some modifications failed
- ✅ Failed files automatically restored
- ✅ Backups kept for manual review
- ✅ Successful changes remain

---

## 📊 Behavior Summary

| Scenario | Backup Created | On Success | On Failure |
|----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **All succeed** | ✅ Yes | 🗑️ Auto-deleted | N/A |
| **Some fail** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Kept | ✅ Auto-restored |
| **All fail** | ✅ Yes | N/A | ✅ Auto-restored |

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### **1. Always Safe**
- ✅ Can't lose your code
- ✅ Automatic protection
- ✅ No manual backup needed

### **2. Auto-Recovery**
- ✅ Failed files restored automatically
- ✅ No manual intervention
- ✅ Original code preserved

### **3. Clean Workspace**
- ✅ Success → backups removed
- ✅ No clutter
- ✅ Only keep backups when needed

### **4. Peace of Mind**
- ✅ Can't forget to backup
- ✅ Always protected
- ✅ Automatic cleanup

## 📝 Examples

### Example 1: All Successful
```bash
$ docai generate ./src

Before:
  utils.py
  helpers.py
  types.py

During:
  utils.py + utils.py.bak
  helpers.py + helpers.py.bak
  types.py + types.py.bak

After (success):
  utils.py (modified)
  helpers.py (modified)
  types.py (modified)
  # .bak files auto-deleted ✅
```

---

### Example 2: Some Failed
```bash
$ docai generate ./src

Before:
  utils.py
  helpers.py (read-only)
  types.py

During:
  utils.py + utils.py.bak
  helpers.py + helpers.py.bak
  types.py + types.py.bak

After (partial failure):
  utils.py (modified) ✅
  helpers.py (restored from backup) ✅
  helpers.py.bak (kept) 💾
  types.py (modified) ✅
  # Only failed file's backup kept
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backup Creation
```javascript
// ALWAYS create backups (no flag needed)
const backupResults = await backupManager.createBackups(filesToBackup);

// If backup fails, stop immediately
if (backupResults.failed.length > 0) {
  console.log('❌ Cannot proceed without backups');
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### On Success
```javascript
// All successful - clean up backups
if (modificationResults.failed.length === 0) {
  await backupManager.cleanupBackups();
  console.log('💡 Backups automatically removed');
}
```

### On Failure
```javascript
// Some failed - restore from backup
if (modificationResults.failed.length > 0) {
  for (const failure of modificationResults.failed) {
    await backupManager.restoreFromBackup(failure.filePath);
    console.log(`✓ Restored ${failure.filePath}`);
  }
  console.log('💾 Backup files kept for failed modifications');
}
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before (Old Behavior):
```bash
# User had to remember --backup
docai generate ./src --backup

# Without it, no safety net
docai generate ./src  # ❌ No backup!
```

### After (New Behavior):
```bash
# Always safe, no flag needed
docai generate ./src  # ✅ Always backed up!

# Auto-cleanup on success
# Auto-restore on failure
```

---

## 💡 Why This Change?

### **1. Safety First**
- Users shouldn't have to remember `--backup`
- Protection should be automatic
- Prevent accidental data loss

### **2. Better UX**
- One less flag to remember
- Automatic cleanup
- Automatic recovery

### **3. Professional Behavior**
- Industry best practice
- Similar to git's behavior
- Fail-safe by default

---

## 🔄 Migration

### Old Command:
```bash
docai generate ./src --backup
```

### New Command:
```bash
docai generate ./src
# Backup is automatic! No flag needed
```

### Old Behavior:
- Manual backup flag
- Manual cleanup with `--cleanup`
- No auto-restore

### New Behavior:
- ✅ Automatic backup
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on success
- ✅ Automatic restore on failure

---

## 📋 Backup File Names

### Simple (default):
```
utils.py → utils.py.bak
```

### Timestamped (with --timestamped):
```
utils.py → utils_2025-10-02T11-02-30.py.bak
```

**Use timestamped when:**
- Want to keep history
- Multiple runs
- Extra safety

---

## 🎯 Summary

**New Behavior:**
- ✅ Backups ALWAYS created
- ✅ Auto-deleted on success
- ✅ Auto-restored on failure
- ✅ No manual intervention needed

**Benefits:**
- 🛡️ Always safe
- 🧹 Always clean
- 🔄 Auto-recovery
- 💡 Peace of mind

**Commands:**
```bash
# Simple - always safe
docai generate ./src

# With timestamped backups
docai generate ./src --timestamped
```

**You can't lose your code anymore!** 🎉
